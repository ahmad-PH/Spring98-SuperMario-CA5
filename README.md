# Spring98-SuperMario-CA5

This is a minimal implementation of the famous and nostalgic game [SuperMario](https://supermariobros.io/), which was chosen as a course project for the Advanced Programming course of University of Tehran, on the Spring 2019 semester. 
As a teaching assistant for this course I felt compelled to write the code that was expected of the students, in order to make sure that the project was neither too big, nor too small. Also it would help bring out all those small ambiguities, that would otherwise be discovered only after the students started working on the project, beforehand and thus help save both the TAs and students significant amounts of time.
